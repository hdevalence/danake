Danake is a lightweight micropayment system which allows anonymous
services to bill for resource usage without compromising privacy or
performance.  It is named in reference to the [danake], a silver coin of
the Persian empire commonly placed in the mouth of the deceased to pay
for passage into the underworld.

Using Danake, a service provider can issue credits to users based on some
application-dependent policy, and allow those users to anonymously spend
those credits to pay for services.  The exact policy is considered
out-of-scope for Danake itself, but for instance, a service provider
could periodically issue credits to each user, or allow users to
purchase credits using Zcash, etc.

Danake is a work-in-progress, and this document will continue to evolve
over time.  The table of contents is visible on the left or via the menu
