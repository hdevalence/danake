# Danake

Danake is a lightweight micropayment system which allows anonymous
services to bill for resource usage without compromising privacy or
performance.  It is named in reference to the [danake], a silver coin of
the Persian empire commonly placed in the mouth of the deceased to pay
for passage into the underworld.
