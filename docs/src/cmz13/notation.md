# Notation

\\(\\mathbb G\\) denotes an abelian group of prime order \\(p\\).  As it
is abelian, it is written additively.  Group elements are denoted by
capital letters \\(A, B, \ldots\\) while scalars are denoted by
lower-case letters \\(a, b, \ldots\\).

This notation differs from the notation in the CMZ13 paper but has the
important advantages that the type of each variable is readily visible
in its notation, and that the notation in the abstract description
matches the notation in the implementation.
